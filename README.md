# Netflix-Content-Strategy-Analysis

This project explores and analyzes the content strategy of **Netflix** using Python and data visualization tools. By evaluating how shows and movies performed in 2023 in terms of viewership hours, release patterns, language distribution, and more, the analysis aims to uncover insights into Netflix’s content planning and audience engagement trends.
Content Strategy Analysis means analyzing how content is created, released, distributed, and consumed to achive specific goals, such as maximizing audience engagement, viewership, brand, reach or revenue.

## 🔍 Objective

To understand **how Netflix creates, releases, and distributes** its content and how viewers **consume** that content — helping us evaluate what kind of content, language, timing, and formats contribute to successful performance.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains information about all the Netflix content released in **2023**, including:

- Title
- Content Type (Show or Movie)
- Language Indicator
- Release Date
- Hours Viewed (in millions)
- Availability Status

For the task of netflix content strategy analysis, we need data based on content titles, types (shows, movie), genre, language, and release details (date, day of the week, season) to understand timing and content performance. Viewership metrics like hours viewed are also crucial for measuring audience engagement.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data cleaning and preprocessing
- **Plotly** for interactive and visually appealing graphs

## 📊 Key Analyses Performed

1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Converted viewership hours to numeric format for analysis.

2. **Content Type Analysis:**
   - Compared total viewership hours between shows and movies.

3. **Language-wise Viewership:**
   - Analyzed which languages performed best in terms of watch hours.

4. **Monthly Trends:**
